ðŸ§  Nand to Tetris â€“ Building a Computer from First Principles
As part of the Nand to Tetris course, I undertook a hands-on journey to build a complete, general-purpose computer system from the ground up. The course is widely recognized for its unique bottom-up approach, combining hardware and software development in a cohesive and comprehensive curriculum.

ðŸ”§ What I Built:
Logic Gates & ALU: Designed basic logic gates (NAND, AND, OR, NOT, XOR, etc.) using a hardware description language (HDL), then composed them into a full Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).

CPU & Memory: Built a central processing unit (CPU) capable of executing machine instructions, along with memory components including RAM and ROM.

Assembler: Developed an assembler in a high-level language to convert Hack assembly code into binary machine language.

Virtual Machine (VM) Translator: Implemented a translator to convert high-level stack-based VM code into low-level assembly instructions.

High-Level Language Compiler: Compiled a custom object-oriented language (Jack) into VM code, including lexical analysis, syntax parsing, and code generation.

Games & Applications: Wrote high-level applications and games to run on the self-built computer platform.

ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways:
Gained a deep understanding of how hardware and software interact, from transistors to operating systems.

Strengthened my skills in abstraction, system design, and low-level programming.

Achieved a perfect score (100/100) on the final project.
